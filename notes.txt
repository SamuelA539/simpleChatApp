server (welcome/set up page?)
    Comps
        client thread: 
            recvs messages - sends to method in serv admin thread to display || chat ui
            other client specific detials ??

        listening/accepting thread: 
            listens for connections reports to serv admin numClis
            accepts connections - checks if can accept  --> starts client threads
            
        serv admin (main)thread? - serv ui (displays connections, takes input)
            *serv admin thread control all info passed to for displaying

    +)early quit out of listening (timed loop while waiting?)

    listening menu cmds?: 
        stoplistening(close port)
        closeconnection
        msgcli
        msgallclis
        read chat
        shutdown server
        see clients list

    methods 
        onRecv: server log & relay message to targets
        onSend: prefix with server message

client
    1) connect to socket
    2) send msgs + menu

    methods 
        onRecv: display element ?exec comands?
        onSend: send msg +id?

Issues
    1) server must be started & blocked from accept before client runs 
        fix: 
            server menu where listening procedure can be manualy started
            client connect options (maybe run general app and takes in port (+ optional comand line args))
    
    2) resterting server while client is running --> client sends message and quits(no text)
    
    3) client error when message to big (+ broken into peices by whitespace)

    +) serv only accept when cli queued up


Notes
    client can run and send message before server accepts for printing
    client message get broken by whitespace
