server 
    +)welcome/set up page?
    +)early quit out of listening (timed loop while waiting?)

    listening menu cmds?: 
        stoplistening(close port)
        closeconnection
        msging(cli & all)
        read chat (store chat as file and print)
        see clients list

client
    1) connect to socket
    2) send msgs + menu

Issues
    1) server must be started & blocked from accept before client runs 
        fix: 
            server menu where listening procedure can be manualy started
            client connect options (maybe run general app and takes in port (+ optional comand line args))

    2)client error when message to big (+ broken into peices by whitespace)


Notes
    client can run and send message before server accepts for printing
    client message get broken by whitespace
